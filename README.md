# Cricket-Data-Warehouse
Databases of cricket data including all international scorecards, and every ball bowled since 2006.

Created in SQL Server. Use the solutions and scripts here to recreate and load the databases.

You can see visualisations and data analyses at Tableau Public and www.blog.com

Scorecard data is 100% accurate and ball-by-ball data is 99.9% accurate. Contributions to also get this to 100% are welcome!
